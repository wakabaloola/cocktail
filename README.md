DESCRIPTION

A convenient and interactive cocktail recipe finder. It includes 123 cocktail recipes with step-by-step instructions.   
There are various search and sort options (including alphabetical, by ingredients, cocktail names). 

cocktails.json: this file contains the actual cocktail recipes   
python.py: this file contains the script (see below).

Feel free to add additional recipes, improve the existing ones, or modify the code as you see fit (subject to the GNU General Public Licence v3 conditions). 

NOTE: In the file mediterranean.py there is a corresponding script for mediterranean food recipes instead of cocktails. I'm including it here because the underlying code is essentially the same (with some minor tweaks). The food recipes it draws from are stored in mediterranean_recipes.json.

HOW TO USE IT

It is very simple; just run the python script with your favourite IDE, or (if you are on a mac) directly in the terminal (and after navigating to the appropriate directory) by typing:

python cocktail.py

You will be presented with the following:
